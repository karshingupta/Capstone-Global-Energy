# Global Health Simulation 

_How are different parts of the world affected by tweaks to energy infrastructure and usage?_

## 1. Intro

Energy usage is a critical topic in the modern world as countries learn to support populations with clean, sustainable practices providing a higher quality of life for all while minimizing impact on natrual resources. This project uses various energy usage attributes to predict the gdp_per_capita for a country. While certainly not comprehensive, [gdp_per_capita](https://www.focus-economics.com/economic-indicator/gdp-per-capita/) is a good baseline measurement for the health of a population.

## 2. Data

Data comes from a [scraped kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy) from the [world bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home). 

The dataset is composed of the following attributes.

* Entity: The name of the country or region for which the data is reported.
* Year: The year for which the data is reported, ranging from 2000 to 2020.
* Access to electricity (% of population): The percentage of population with access to electricity.
* Access to clean fuels for cooking (% of population): The percentage of the population with primary reliance on clean fuels.
* Renewable-electricity-generating-capacity-per-capita: Installed Renewable energy capacity per person
* Financial flows to developing countries (US $): Aid and assistance from developed countries for clean energy projects.
* Renewable energy share in total final energy consumption (%): Percentage of renewable energy in final energy consumption.
* Electricity from fossil fuels (TWh): Electricity generated from fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas) in terawatt-hours.
* Electricity from nuclear (TWh): Electricity generated from nuclear power in terawatt-hours.
* Electricity from renewables (TWh): Electricity generated from renewable sources (hydro, solar, wind, etc.) in terawatt-hours.
* Low-carbon electricity (% electricity): Percentage of electricity from low-carbon sources (nuclear and renewables).
* Primary energy consumption per capita (kWh/person): Energy consumption per person in kilowatt-hours.
* Energy intensity level of primary energy (MJ/$2011 PPP GDP): Energy use per unit of GDP at purchasing power parity.
* Value_co2_emissions (metric tons per capita): Carbon dioxide emissions per person in metric tons.
* Renewables (% equivalent primary energy): Equivalent primary energy that is derived from renewable sources.
* GDP growth (annual %): Annual GDP growth rate based on constant local currency.
* GDP per capita: Gross domestic product per person.
* Density (P/Km2): Population density in persons per square kilometer.
* Land Area (Km2): Total land area in square kilometers.
* Latitude: Latitude of the country's centroid in decimal degrees.
* Longitude: Longitude of the country's centroid in decimal degrees.
